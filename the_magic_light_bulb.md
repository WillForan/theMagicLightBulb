# kingdom
The perfect soft yellow glow symmetrical illuminates the land of a magical kingdom.
When the sun is down or when clouds are thick, the light's warmth fills the land.

# kitchen
Of all the lights in the royal house, the source of this, 
two bulbs in two sockets hanging above the stove from the hood, are preferred most.

Eventually, after years of switching on and switching off, neither filament can be called on to shine!

# pop

Emily, the pixie queen, sad and concerned, reaches out to them. 
Both filaments light brighter than ever before as the touched bulb explodes!
[ broken bulb and magic bulb ]
We know now what Emily has yet to discover:
  one bulb sacrificed itself to harness and transfer the magic pixie touch to the other, resurrecting it.

# Fixer
Besieged by grief, Emily conscripted the royal court's lower maintenance gremlin to restore her beloved fixture.

# other lights 
Will sets out on his task by first appropriating the bulb of a neighboring lamp. This new light, while brilliant in the lamp, does not shine along side the other now magic bulb.
Curious, Will tries the bulb from a different fixture with the same results.

# bad socket
Now with a sure theory, he pairs the bulbs to their opposite socket, confident that the socket was damaged by the explosion. But in the would-be-broken socket, the magic bulb radiates.
In any configuration, always the magic bulb and only the magic bulb shines. And if the magic bulb isn't connected, there is no light.

# Pat
This is not a situation the royal court's lower maintenance department can handle.
Will signals the high noble gnome of electricity from a far away land.
Pat, the noble gnome, is amused and sends Will an instrument to measure the resistance of light bulbs and power provided to sockets.
[ pat and the instrument ]

# Magic
Will measures all the bulbs and he checks all the sockets. When all the bulbs read 0 Ohms and the sockets report sufficient voltage, the gremlin and gnome have a conclusion.
The bulb is magic.

# endless mates
How does one pair an ordinary bulb with a magic one? Will must answer this before reporting back to the queen.
Guided only by trail and error, the gremlin set out to interchange every bulb in the house until the magic bulb would take no more.

# its broke
"I broke the magic bulb." Will cried in correspondence with the gnome in a far away land. But Pat, patient and phlegmatic, calmly prompted the gremlin: "try again." The alarm was premature, the magic bulb resumed after a small adjustment.

After some time and many attempts, the magic bulb took a mate and shared the magic. The kitchen again basked in a warm glow. And the queen was happy.
